# Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

Developed interactive sales dashboard with KPIs, trend analysis, and performance metrics. Created visualizations for customer insights, financial metrics, and time-based analysis with filters.

## Below are the key insights from the developed dashboard:

**Sales by Salesperson:** A bar chart showing sales performance by individual salespeople.

**Sales Targets vs. Actuals:** A gauge or bar chart showing how actual sales compare to targets.

**Monthly/Quarterly Sales:** A line or bar chart showing sales trends over months or quarters.

**Year-over-Year Growth:** A line or bar chart showing sales growth compared to the previous year.

**Revenue and Profit:** Cards or KPIs showing total revenue and profit.

**Profit Margin:** A gauge or bar chart showing profit margins.
Interactive Filters:

**Date Range Selector:** A slicer to filter the data by specific date ranges.

**Region/Product/Customer Filters:** Slicers to filter the data by region, product, or customer.
